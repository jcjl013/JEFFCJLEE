				Where rainbows bow and willows weep

				Where sunlight glows and moonbeams creep

				<br/><br/>
				We sat within a field of green 
				<br/>
				Staring at the peaceful scene 
				<br/>
				Stretching far as we could see 
				<br/>
				Were flowers blooming bright and free
				<br/><br/>
				On glowing sand kissed by the sun 
				<br/>
				Your warmth was there for everyone 
				<br/>
				As sunlight cast its parting glow 
				<br/>
				Sinking â€˜neath waves, we watched it go
				<br/><br/>
				We sat beneath wise autumn's oak 
				<br/>
				Caressed the bark with tender stroke 
				<br/>
				As colors changed and leaves they fell 
				<br/>
				We said a silent last farewell
				<br/><br/>
				'Tween flower's bloom and darkest gloom 
				<br/>
				'Tween ocean's flow and sunlight's glow 
				<br/>
				'Tween colors change and oak leave's fall 
				<br/>
				You wait for me
				<br/><br/>
				We sat amidst the snow's descent 
				<br/>
				Like white rain from the heavens sent 
				<br/>
				Breath condensed before your face
				<br/>
				I held you in our last embrace
				<br/>
				We gazed up at the somber sky 
				<br/>
				With quiet calm you then reply 
				<br/>
				"Though in Spring you'll begin anew 
				<br/>
				In the next world I wait for you"
				<br/><br/>
				Where rainbows bow and willows weep 
				<br/>
				Where sunlight glows and moonbeams creep 
				<br/>
				Where shooting stars embrace the sea 
				<br/>
				'Tween love and loss you wait for me
